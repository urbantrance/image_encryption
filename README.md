# image_encryption
This project is a simple image encryption tool that uses pixel manipulation to encrypt and decrypt images. It allows users to perform operations like swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel. The tool is designed to help secure images by making them unrecognizable until decrypted with the correct key.
