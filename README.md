Image Encryption Tool
Overview
This project is a simple image encryption tool that uses pixel manipulation to encrypt and decrypt images. It allows users to perform operations like swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel. The tool is designed to help secure images by making them unrecognizable until decrypted with the correct key.

Features
Encrypt Images: Encrypts images by altering pixel values and swapping colors.

Decrypt Images: Decrypts images by reversing the alterations and swaps, restoring the original image.

User Input: Prompts users to input the image file paths and encryption/decryption key interactively.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Pillow library (for image processing)
